First of all, I want to give thanks to Prof. Dr. Dr. Daniel J. Strauss for providing me with such an interesting topic and granting me the freedom of working in such an independent manner. This allowed me to fully invest myself in the design and realization of this project.\\

Further, I would like to thank the entire staff of the Systems Neuroscience and Neurotechnology Unity for creating such a kind and supportive environment. \\
In particular, I want to say thanks to Dr. Lars Haab, who not only was always content to help but also willing to supervise me on yet another one of my projects.\\

Last but not least, I want to express my deepest gratitude to my family and friends. 
Your continuous support throughout the years is what kept me motivated and made this thesis possible in the first place.\\

Thank You!
