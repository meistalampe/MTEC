RQ 1: Is it possible to get real-time access to the data we record with the Empatica E4?
RQ 2: Is it possible to detect and distinguish different degrees of mental workload, as well as two emotional states, such as pleasant and unpleasant, using common machine learning techniques on three physiological signals that were recorded with the Empatica E4 in an experimental setting?
RQ 3: Which algorithm is best suited for the classification task introduced in RQ2?
\section{Future Work}
-large scale data collection with HRI
-ml artifact detection
-explore nonlinear features (picard)
-linear fusion of classifiers
