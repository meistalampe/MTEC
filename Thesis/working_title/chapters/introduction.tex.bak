% Introduction
We live in the age of automation. In fact automation, in one form or another, has been a dominating force in almost every branch of industry for what has been the better part of a century now. Automation can be defined as the creation and application of technology by which the production and delivery of various goods and services is controlled and monitored with minimal human assistance. Automation can be encountered in many different forms, from a simple automatic control loop, that compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value to generate a regulating feedback, up to an artificial intelligence that is used in cars to detect pedestrians and perform an emergency break if necessary. Introducing static automation into a work environment causes a change in roles, where machines exceed their role as tools and the workforce, once active operators, become passive monitors. Consequently causing the quality and quantity of mental workload to change. 
The traditional form of automation is static automation. In this form, automation is an all-or-none technology either performing a task for us or not \cite{Byrne2006}. Although, there are numerous benefits, such as relieving workers from the strain of performing repetitive tasks, there is increasing evidence that static automation comes at the price of impaired decision making, manual skill degradation, loss of situational awareness, and monitoring inefficiency \cite{Byrne2006}. 
A considerable disadvantage to a system that relies heavily on human operators to manage their monitoring tasks perfectly, especially if the automation quality is insufficient. 


%\section{Motivation}
%Physical illness, distress and injury are all well known to be possible consequences of a stressful workplace. 
%Therefore, stress management not only has become a key component in today's industry, but also a common research topic in recent years. Where disciplines such as organizational psychology attempt to address this matter by offering practical guidelines for the assessment and mitigation of workplace stressors, neuroergonomics merges the disciplines of neuroscience and ergonomics to provide for a deeper understanding of the neural bases of perceptual and cognitive functions in relation to technologies and settings in the real world. 
%In this thesis, we take a neuroergonomic approach to optimize stress management in collaborative workplaces by regulating the information flow of a human-robot-interface (\gls{hri}) according to changes in the mental state of the user. 
%Using a commercial wristworn device in combination with a processing unit, we created a system that is capable of obtaining and interpreting psycho-physiological information in real-time.
%We believe that the application of such a system could be a potent tool in risk management and therefore be greatly beneficial for the overall reduction of stress related incidents at collaborative workplaces.
